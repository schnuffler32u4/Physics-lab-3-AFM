# Results
We may categorize the results into multiple categories, they are achieved by processing the different images corresponding to the different samples.
## Calibration sample
This can then be categorized into measurements obtained with the different calibration tips. In order to obtain the different values for the quantities mutliple measurements of distance were taken with the built-in tool within Gwyddion for the procedure and then these were combined into a csv file that was acessed in pyhton and then the value and standard deviation was calculated.deviation  
Therefore, for the dynamic hole size we obtain
- 4.5 ± 0.2  microns
And for the static the hole size we obtain is 
- 4.46 ± 0.08 microns
These are both quite a bit different than what we would expect from the data that we have been given.
